# python-number-guessing
python number guessing

## This program ONLY USES the randint function in the random library

## This program has:
* Error trapping
* Input streams

### Rules
Player must enter a lower and upper boundary, the number of guesses allowed (up to 20), and the computer will generate a random number between the boundary. The player then submits each guess individually until they either successfully guess the correct number or run out of guesses (at which point the generated number will be revealed).
